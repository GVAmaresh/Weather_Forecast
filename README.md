In this project, we've used React and Node.js to create an application that provides weather forecast information and the ability to convert between latitude and longitude (lat and lng) coordinates and city names.

To set up and run this project, follow these steps:

Please note that you should have Node.js installed on your computer before following these steps.

Step 1: Download Node.js

First, make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download it from the official website: Node.js Downloads.

Step 2: Setting Up the Backend

Open your terminal and navigate to the "backend" directory of the project.

Run the following commands to install the required dependencies:


>>> npm install express nodemon cors
After the installation is complete, start the backend server:

>>> npm i
To download the requirements for react 
>>> npm start

Step 3: Running the Frontend

Open another terminal window.

Navigate to the "frontend" directory of the project.

Run the following command to start the frontend application:

>>> npm start

This will launch the project, and you can interact with the weather forecast and coordinate conversion features.
